      <p class="container wow animate__fadeIn" data-wow-duration="5s">Finding a photographer for weddings is definitely
        a hard task and can make this even harder depending on the date, venue or season. Marriage is a once in a
        lifetime experience and getting it right it is very essential. When looking for a wedding photographer, you
        should look further beyond the price itself. Keeping things simple and easy is what I like to do, and I’ve
        decided that my prices should imitate this. I am never the kind of person to try and cost you extra with hidden
        charges or any unexpected requirements. Just what you need nice and easy, elegant posed photographs, great
        natural shots and amazing photos! I think I am the right photographer for you, I like to watch the day unfold
        and simply capture it in front of my lens. From getting ready and planning, to the first dance, I want to make
        sure every moment is captured and ready for you to look back on for years to come. It’s why I bring all my
        skills to your big day, and I ensure that the photos bring you back to that same special moment. With a relaxed
        and easy approach, the joy and sheer happiness of your wedding day is what drives my photography. I capture all
        the emotions displayed, the laughs, the tears and the important and crucial details you have chosen. I simply
        want to provide you the emotive and beautiful images you deserve. My friendly yet professional nature makes it
        very easy for you to invite me into your world. On a budget? That doesn’t matter, I am here to help you with any
        needs you have regarding price or anything of the sorts, I just want to make your big day special and memorable.

<h1>OPTIONAL EXTRAS</h1>
<h4>Additional coverage-£100/HOUR</h4>    
<h6>FREE PRE–WEDDING TRIAL SHOOT</h6>
<p>I feel that a pre-wedding shoot is essential for both the groom and bride, as well as for me as a photographer. It usually if not always takes an hour. We start with a pre-wedding meeting, whether we get coffee, or even a beer, we can informally discuss your big day plans and what you dream of on that day. Then we go off to take a mini photo shoot at a location of your choice, parks and countryside’s are what I personally choose. We go for thirty minutes to one hour and take pictures every now and then whilst discussing what you are looking for etc. Once we are finished with the shoot and you realise it wasn’t as horrific as you thought it’d be, I will start to work on your photos. In the next two days, I will email you all your photos that were taken, in colour and black and white along with a watermark over the top of each image for you to review. By then, you will have an idea if I am the right photographer for your special day or not. If you are happy and are ready to book with me, I will ask for a 20% deposit and I will ask you to fill out a booking form online. Once everything has been returned to me, I will resend the photos without a watermark on them. This service is completely free of charge and you don’t have to book with me if you are not happy with the photos. You can simply walk off without any commitment to me.</p>
